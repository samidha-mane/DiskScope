# DiskScope
An interactive visual tool for simulating Disk Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems. It includes head-movement graphs, seek-time metrics, and a step-by-step animation module. Built with clean, responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my understanding of OS concepts and practical web development skills.
